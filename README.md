A dirty hack for syncing FFXIV hunt train status between Discord and a Google sheet document.

If you want to try to get this running on your own server, you can contact me for example on Discord and I might be able to help a bit in the initial setup.

I'd advise against using this project as any kind of example, other than maybe as a cautionary example.
